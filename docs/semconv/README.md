# Semantic Conventions used by OJR Project

This project uses the [OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/README.md) to define the conventions for metrics, traces and logs. Some are from OpenTelemetry official documents. Some are just proposals. Here are some of the conventions used by this project:

- [relational database](relational-database.md)
- [system (host)](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/system/system-metrics.md)
- [system (host) convention used in OTel Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/hostmetricsreceiver)
